3/4 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 cup unsalted butter, softened
1 cup sugar
1 egg, beaten
1 tablespoon milk
Powdered sugar, for rolling out dough","Sugar Cookies","Sift together flour, baking powder, and salt. Set aside. Place butter and sugar in large bowl of electric stand mixer and beat until light in color. Add egg and milk and beat to combine. Put mixer on low speed, gradually add flour, and beat until mixture pulls away from the side of the bowl. Divide the dough in half, wrap in waxed paper, and refrigerate for 2 hours.
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.
Sprinkle surface where you will roll out dough with powdered sugar. Remove 1 wrapped pack of dough from refrigerator at a time, sprinkle rolling pin with powdered sugar, and roll out dough to 1/4-inch thick. Move the dough around and check underneath frequently to make sure it is not sticking. If dough has warmed during rolling, place cold cookie sheet on top for 10 minutes to chill. Cut into desired shape, place at least 1-inch apart on greased baking sheet, parchment, or silicone baking mat, and bake for 7 to 9 minutes or until cookies are just beginning to turn brown around the edges, rotating cookie sheet halfway through baking time. Let sit on baking sheet for 2 minutes after removal from oven and then move to complete cooling on wire rack. Serve as is or ice as desired. Store in airtight container for up to 1 week.",46,3

Alternately, transfer the skillet to the oven for 5 minutes until the whites are set and the yolks are still runny. Garnish with reserved parsley.",49,3
52,"Stuff couscous and beef into sweet bell peppers for a nutritious protein-packed meal. The bold colors of the antioxidant-packed bell peppers aren't just for decoration-the more bright colors you can pile onto your plate, the healthier your meal will be.","2 medium carrots, cut into chunks
2 stalks celery, cut into chunks
1 large shallot, cut into chunks
1 1/2 tablespoons olive oil
1/2 pound lean ground beef
2 tablespoons plus 4 teaspoons tomato paste
1/3 cup chopped fresh parsley, dill or a combination
1/3 cup golden raisins
2 tablespoons red wine vinegar
Kosher salt
4 red, yellow, orange or green bell peppers or a mix of colors, halved lengthwise and seeded
1/2 cup whole wheat couscous
3/4 cup grated asiago cheese","Sweet and Sour Couscous-Stuffed Peppers","Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Pulse the carrots, celery and shallots in a food processor until coarsely chopped.
Heat 1 tablespoon of the olive oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium high. Add the chopped vegetables and cook, stirring frequently, until light golden and soft, 8 to 10 minutes. (Add a splash of water if the mixture begins to stick.) Add the ground beef and 4 teaspoons of the tomato paste and cook, breaking the mixture up with a wooden spoon, until browned, about 4 minutes. Add 1/2 cup water, the parsley, raisins, 1 tablespoon of the vinegar and 3/4 teaspoon salt. Bring to a simmer and cook until most of the water is absorbed and the mixture gets saucy, about 1 minute. Let cool slightly.
Meanwhile, toss the pepper halves with the remaining 1/2 tablespoon oil in a microwave-safe bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and microwave until the peppers are pliable, 10 to 12 minutes. Carefully uncover the bowl and pour out any liquid that has accumulated.
Stir the couscous into the beef mixture. Whisk together the remaining 2 tablespoons tomato paste, 1 tablespoon vinegar and 3/4 cup water in the bottom of a large baking dish.
Carefully transfer the peppers to the baking dish cut-side up and fill each pepper with the couscous mixture. Sprinkle with the cheese. Cover with foil and bake until the peppers are tender and the stuffing is hot, 20 to 25 minutes. Serve warm or at room temperature drizzled with the tomato cooking liquid.",46,1
57,"The stovetop-to-oven cast-iron skillet technique in this recipe is our go-to for achieving crispy, juicy chicken thighs. If you’re tight on time, the chicken is delicious without the butter sauce (simply plate the thighs straight out of the oven).","4 skin-on, bone-in chicken thighs (about 2 pounds)
Kosher salt and coarsely ground black pepper
1/3 cup champagne vinegar
1/3 cup dry white wine
2 shallots, finely chopped
1/2 lemon, juiced
2 bay leaves
1/2 cup heavy cream
1/2 pound (2 sticks) unsalted butter, cubed
1/4 cup chopped chives","Skillet Chicken Thighs with White Wine–Butter Sauce","Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F.
Pat chicken dry with paper towels. Sprinkle on both sides with 1 1/2 tspns each salt and pepper.
Heat a large oven-proof skillet (preferably cast iron) over medium-high heat. Add the chicken thighs to the skillet skin-side down and cook, moving them around once or twice to ensure even browning, until the skin is very golden brown, 11 to 12 minutes.
Turn off the heat. Grasp a wad of paper towels with tongs and mop up excess fat in the bottom of the skillet—this will prevent the grease from spattering all over your oven. Repeat several times until there’s only a thin film of oil over the bottom of the skillet.
Transfer the skillet to the oven and roast until the chicken is almost cooked through, 6 to 8 minutes. Flip the thighs so they are skin side up, then continue roasting until no longer pink near the bone, another 6 minutes. Remove the skillet from the oven and transfer the chicken thighs to a plate, skin side up. Wipe out the skillet and set aside.
Meanwhile, start your sauce. Combine the vinegar, wine, shallots, lemon juice and bay leaves in a heavy 2-quart saucepan. Simmer over medium heat until the mixture is reduced to a wet paste, 8 to 10 minutes. Add the cream and continue to simmer until the mixture is reduced to about 2 tablespoons.
Reduce the heat to low and remove the bay leaves. Add a few chunks of the butter and whisk constantly until melted, then add a few more chunks and whisk again until melted. Continue adding and whisking the butter, which should melt into a creamy emulsion, until all the butter is incorporated, about 4 minutes. Do not let the sauce go over 130 degrees F or it will separate. If the sauce starts to break, remove from the heat, add 2 ice cubes and whisk until it cools down and comes back together.
Season the sauce with 1/2 teaspoon salt and a pinch of pepper. Transfer it to the cast iron skillet, nestle the chicken on top and sprinkle the whole dish with chives.",56,3
58,,"1 medium head cauliflower, stem removed
3 teaspoons canola or vegetable oil
2 large eggs, lightly beaten
3 cloves garlic, minced
One 1-inch piece fresh ginger, peeled and grated
1 cup frozen mixed peas and carrots, thawed
1/4 cup thinly sliced scallions
1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons low-sodium soy sauce, plus more for serving, optional
2 tablespoons sesame oil
2 cooked chicken breasts, diced (I used a rotisserie chicken)
Hot sauce, for serving, optional","Chicken Cauliflower "Fried Rice"","Cut the cauliflower into chunks. Working in batches, pulse the cauliflower in a food processor until coarse in texture, like rice. This recipe uses about 4 cups of cauliflower rice. If you have any leftover, save it for another use.
Heat a wok or large skillet over medium-high heat. Add 1 teaspoon of the canola oil. Add the eggs and quickly scramble. Transfer the eggs to a plate and set aside. Heat the remaining 2 teaspoons canola oil. Add the garlic and ginger and cook, stirring constantly, about 1 minute. Add the peas and carrots, scallions and cauliflower. Stir-fry until the vegetables are tender, about 5 minutes.
As the vegetables are cooking, whisk the soy sauce and sesame oil together in a small bowl. Stir the sauce and chicken into the cauliflower mixture. Cook an additional minute or 2. Stir the cooked eggs back into the mixture. Serve with hot sauce and additional soy sauce if desired.

59,"This take on a classic Italian-American recipe is super easy to make. Slightly reducing the cream and adding a hefty dose of cheese means you don't have to use flour to thicken the sauce.","Kosher salt
12 ounces fettuccine
Olive oil, for tossing
3/4 pound large shrimp (about 16), peeled and deveined, tails removed
Freshly ground black pepper
1 stick (8 tablespoons) unsalted butter
2 cups heavy cream
2 pinches freshly grated nutmeg
1 1/2 cups freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese
","Shrimp Fettuccine Alfredo","Bring a large pot of water to a boil, and salt generously. Add the pasta, and boil according to package directions until al dente, tender but still slightly firm. Strain, and toss with a splash of oil.
Meanwhile, arrange the shrimp in a single layer on a large pie pan or paper plate, and pat them with a paper towel until completely dry. Season with salt and pepper.
Heat a large skillet over medium heat, and add 2 tablespoons of the butter. When the butter melts, raise the heat to medium-high, and invert the plate of shrimp over the skillet so the shrimp fall into the pan all at once. Cook the shrimp, without moving them, until the underside is pink, 1 to 2 minutes. Flip the shrimp, and cook until fully pink and cooked through, about 2 minutes more. Transfer the shrimp to a bowl.
Reduce the heat to medium, and add the remaining 6 tablespoons butter. Scrape the bottom of the skillet with a wooden spoon to release any browned bits. When the butter has mostly melted, whisk in the cream and nutmeg and bring to a simmer, then cook for 2 minutes. Lower the heat to keep the sauce warm.
Whisk the Parmigiano-Reggiano into the sauce. Add the shrimp and cooked pasta, and toss well. Season with salt and pepper. Serve hot in heated bowls.
Cook’s Note
Don't worry if it seems like there is too much sauce. As soon as everything is tossed together, the sauce will start to cling to the pasta and thicken before your eyes.",54,2
62,"Cooking eggs in pesto is a great alternative to frying in butter and an easy way to enhance their flavor. When the pesto is heated, the oil separates from the rest of the ingredients and gives your eggs crispy, fried edges. ","1/4 cup store-bought or homemade pesto
2 large eggs
Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper","Pesto Fried Eggs","Spread the pesto in an even layer in an 8-inch nonstick skillet; bring to a gentle simmer over medium-low heat, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the eggs on top of the pesto and season with 1/4 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper; continue to cook until the egg whites are just set and the oil has separated from the pesto, 3 to 4 minutes. Remove from the heat and cover with a tight-fitting lid (or a heatproof plate or a baking sheet). Let sit until the whites are completely set and the yolks are still runny, 1 to 2 minutes.",54,3
63,"We skipped the white sugar and went all in with dark brown sugar, which gives our cookies the ideal chewiness and perfect level of sweetness. The recipe makes a lot of cookies, but in our opinion, this is never a problem!","2 3/4 cups all-purpose flour (see Cook's Note)
1 1/2 teaspoons fine salt 
1 teaspoon baking powder 
1 teaspoon baking soda 
2 1/2 sticks unsalted butter, softened 
1 3/4 cups packed dark brown sugar 
2 large eggs, at room temperature 
2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract or vanilla bean paste 
One 12-ounce bag semisweet chocolate chips (about 2 cups) ","The Best Chewy Chocolate Chip Cookies","Sift the flour, salt, baking powder and baking soda into a large bowl.
Beat the butter and brown sugar in another large bowl with an electric mixer on medium-high speed until pale and fluffy, about 4 minutes, scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed. (Use the paddle attachment for a stand mixer.) Beat in the eggs one at a time, then beat in the vanilla. Reduce the mixer speed to low. Add the dry ingredients and beat until combined. Stir in the chocolate chips by hand.  
Press plastic wrap directly onto the surface of the dough and refrigerate at least 1 hour or preferably overnight. 
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.  
Use a 1-ounce ice cream scoop to scoop half the dough onto the prepared baking sheets, spacing about 2 inches apart. Chill the remaining dough while you bake the first batch. 
Bake until the cookies are golden around the edges but still soft in the middle, 12 to 15 minutes. Let the cookies cool for 10 minutes on the baking sheets, then transfer them to a wire rack to cool completely. Cool the baking sheets completely, then line with parchment paper again if necessary and repeat the scooping and baking process with the remaining dough. 
Cook’s Note
When measuring flour, we spoon it into a dry measuring cup and level off excess. (Scooping directly from the bag compacts the flour, resulting in dry baked goods.)",49,4
